========

This repo consists of slides for my talk to the DVDC and SPDC meetup groups in DC. It also includes the demos and their source code. You will need the latest versions of `slidify`, `slidifyLibraries` and `rCharts` to replicate the slides.

```S
mypkgs = c("slidify", "slidifyLibraries", "rCharts")
devtools:::install_github(mypkgs, "ramnathv", ref = "dev")
```
